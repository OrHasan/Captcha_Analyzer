GIT Commits:

Version 2
+ Added the Data/History folders to sync the history of past runs between different machines
+ Code changes:
 * main:
  - Fixed "use_median" & "use_dilate_erode" - will now be True/False instead of String type
  - Added Selenium Webdrive selection according to the host system (by using Gershon code: "detect_arch")
  - Added more folders division for the history results
  - Fixed the history result pictures indexes
  - The cleared captcha file will also be used for the history results in the end of each loop instead of leaving it in the "Data" folder
  - Added the attempt number to each result in the "History" folder
 
 * def_config_file:
  - Added new sections to the Configurations file (data_folder, process_history_dir, cleared_history_dir, methods_test_dir)
  - Added dependencies between different sections & keys if they are using the same root ( %(..)s, ${..:..} )
  - Fixed places with constant file name and replaced it with his variable
  
 * local_test:
  - Fixed "use_median" & "use_dilate_erode" - will now be True/False instead of String type
  - Added filters test folders creation in case they don't exist
  - Added a test for the uniformity of the results for the "Model Test" instead of the need for the user to check it by himself


Version 2.1
Added requirements file


Version 3
+ Added .gitignore
+ Moved code files from "Code" folder to "lib" folder (works better when loading the files)
+ Fixed the configurations file. Instead of using both "%()s" & "${}", using just the "${}" format
+ Added more image history files
+ Added version history notes file (may have missing data, a first try to work with such file)
+ New code:
 * general_funcs:
  - Seperated the "captcha_funcs" functions file into captcha relevant functions and more general ones
  
 * load_analyzer_config_file:
  - Takes care of all the configuration data inside an orderly class. Replacing many lines inside the "main" & "local_test", and removed the need of huge amount of variables to each function.
  
+ Code changes:
 * main:
  - Added "ExtendedInterpolation" to use the extended interpolation ("${}") instead of the regular interpolation ("%()s") inside the configurations file
  - Removed all the lines that loaded the configuration file variables (see: "load_analyzer_config_file")
  
 * local_test:
  - Added "ExtendedInterpolation" to use the extended interpolation ("${}") instead of the regular interpolation ("%()s") inside the configurations file
  - Removed all the lines that loaded the configuration file variables (see: "load_analyzer_config_file")
  - Added a direct import to "makedirs"
  - Replaced the "model_test_results" for loop with list comprehensions ("inline for")
  - Added a simple description for the progress bar

 * captcha_funcs
  - Removed the need of huge amount of variables to each function (see: "load_analyzer_config_file")
  - Commented a print line to avoid a conflict with the updating terminal progress bar (printing while he is updating will lead to multiple lines of the progress bar). For the same reason the "client_config" is being loaded externally as the client is loaded directly from the "load_analyzer_config_file" file and prints an automatic message to the terminal after it been loaded
  
 * local_test_funcs:
  - Removed the need of huge amount of variables to each function (see: "load_analyzer_config_file")

 * def_analyzer_config_file:
  - Changed to more specific name from "def_config_file" so there will be some different from other projects
  - replaced "%()s" interpolations with "${}" ones
  - Copied changed made in the Dorking project:
  -- Moved all the free lines after the functions into a new function named "read_config_file" that need to be first called from the main program ("config_file" constant is now a function input)
  -- Added "config.read(config_file)" line after every time the configuration file is changed to also update the program loaded data


Version 3.1
+ Fixed the "requirements.txt" file
+ Little changes as to automatic code inspection, including: typos & missing spaces


Version 3.2
+ New code: moved the main part of the code into "solve_captcha" file
+ Added 2 new parameters:
 - selenium_minimum_wait, to declare minimum wait time for an element before throwing an error
 - selenium_condition_wait, to declare how much time to wait in case of a specific condition for an element (currently not in use)
+ Combined the 4 files count indexes variables to a single key-value pairs
+ Added function output of the page cookies (ZHE & PHPSESSID) to be able to use them to pass the captcha request in other codes
+ Added program terminate condition in case of failing to solve the captcha in all the attempts
+ Added more image history files
